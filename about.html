		I am 19 years old and I am a freshmen student of INHA university in Tashkent. I became professional interior designer when I was 16 years old and I have made so many projects on them. Now I am learning programming skills, which would be helpful in my future. From my childhood I am fluent speaker in 3 languages: russian, english, turkish.</br>
I have studied at two schools.My first school was TUIS(Tashkent Ulugbek International School). I have studied there till sixth grade and from seventh grade I move to School #71. </br>
Having finished the school successfully I have entered to academic lyceum "International-House Tashkent". Then having graduated the lyceum I have entered to 3 universities and I have chosen to study at INHA university.
